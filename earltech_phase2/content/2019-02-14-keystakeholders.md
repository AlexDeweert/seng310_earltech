Upon the creation of this application, the consideration of stakeholder needs and requirements proved to be an imperative asset to deliver an excellent final product. Being the main product users, project implementation and optimization revolved around stakeholder preferences and enjoyment. We have taken fine consideration as to whom will be directly active with our product, and have taken the steps to provide the most pleasurable and productive solution possible for the following stakeholders:

* Students
* Parents
* University/Faculty Members (Professors)
* Faculty Members of Other Universities (For Online Learning and/or Exchange students)

    <h1>User Experience Goals</h1>
    <ol type="I">
            <li>
                <h2>Helpful:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>All users who use the CalendarCompanion would like the application to be helpful from the very beginning to the end of their session. In that regard, users should have access to definitions, tutorials, and hover icons.
                    </p>
                <p>A user would like to have access to a virtual assistant chat interface for more information that might not be accessible or readily apparent after use of the traditional definitions, tutorials, or hover icons.
                    </p>
                <p>A new student who has no idea what courses to take or register in would like the application to be helpful in terms of offering an overview graph of suggested courses, and suggesting a course path.
                    </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>Motivating</h2>
                <p>A user who is new to academics may feel overwhelmed and unmotivated, but after using the application would like to feel a renewed sense of motivation due to a helpful course-type specific set of suggestions for organization, studying, learning, homework habits, and other resources.
                    </p>
       
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Not frustrating:</h2>
                <p>Using the mapping feature of the application doesnâ€™t result in a frustrating experience due to freezes, misinformation, or ambiguous map icon design.

                    </p>
            </li>
          
        </ol>

    <h1>The software should accomplish the following for the specific stakeholder/user</h1>
    <h2>Usability Goal</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <h3>Student:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Either a student user or parent would like to flawlessly pinpoint classroom locations, and organize their schedule based on a dynamic map that may change with a potentially changing course lineup.
                    A student or course advisor would like the ability to swap or drop courses without major scheduling errors or unforeseen repercussions.
                    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Efficiency:</h3>
            <p> A student user would like routes to their next class to be optimized in terms of travel-time, but not necessarily distance say. For example, if the shortest path is congested with students during the busiest end-of-class times, the path would be the least congested, possibly longer than the shortest distance, but still travel time optimal.
                </p>
            <p>A student or University faculty member, such as a course advisor, would like the CalendarCompanion to carry out tasks in a fast an efficient manner. Students would like speed for obvious reasons, but the faculty member has a busy schedule and deals with many students every day, so program time efficiency is paramount.
                </p>
            <p>A university faculty member from another university would like the ability to efficiently create transfer or exchange friendly course mappings in a time efficient and painless way.
                </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Utility:</h3>
            <p>The student user would like to have access to a suite of features that, while normally available through brute force Coursespace navigation, are available through a centralized CalendarCompanion application, easily accessible and integrated.
                </p>
            <p>University faculty members would like the ability to add or remove course offerings.
                </p>
            <p>University faculty members would like the ability to add additional lecture sections based on waitlist numbers.
                </p>
            <p>A parent would like to have the ability to check their child-students grades and transcripts.
                </p>
            <p>A parent would like to have access to course reviews, professor reviews, and past course averages to ensure that child-students get the best education possible.
                </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Learnability:</h3>
            <p> A new student user who might feel overwhelmed by the beginning of their University experience would like a basic tutorial to assist with learning a centralized and integrated tool such as CalendarCompanion.
                </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Memorability:</h3>
            <p>A student user, after learning to use CalendarCompanion for the first time, would like to have memorable icons, and non-overwhelming button designs or complex button naming conventions.
                </p>
            <p>
                A student user would like to have the ability to go through the tutorial system again, or to have access to a hover-and-help pointer option to get more information about what a button or menu item does.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

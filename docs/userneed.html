    <h1>User needs for the system</h1>
    <p>In general, the device CalendarCompanion provides all users with an organized schedule for their entire post secondary career. For exchange and cooperative work, it may accompany third party universities as well. For example, if an individual would like to go on exchange in the Fall semester of 2022, they would be able to pick courses from the chosen exchange university for that future semester. If the student changes their mind and wishes to not pursue co-op, they may easily drop their co-op semester and replace it with another semester to obtain their goal of specific year graduation. Similarly, they may instead redistribute the credits they would’ve obtained during co-op towards other semesters. In another instance, say an individual would like to do an online course while doing their cooperative work term. The user would be prompted to simply sign in and add the desired online course to the preferred semester they would like to complete it.
    </p>

    <p>The user may interact with the application on a laptop or mobile device. But the distinguishing effect of CalendarCompanion for a user is the ability to not only plan one distinct semester of studies, but to structure an entire course map for the duration of their degree. Another remarkable feature is that users may query their very own Virtual Assistant. If faced with a scheduling issue or course clash, the virtual assistant will run though tests and create a solution. The Virtual Assistant may adjust your classes based around your preferred graduating year, favorable studying hours and even distance between classes.
    </p>

    <p>The users of the application will be UVic students, faculty involved in administrative roles, and IT personnel.  It is strongly recommended for high school students to utilize the application, as university is a different and more complicated learning environment, and having a structured and organized degree map planned is immensely beneficial. As well, parents may visit the course map and take further inspections to validate the education that their youth receives. The application is available in 30 different languages, providing support for international students and families</p>

    <p>For the needs of the faculty, Say a professor needs to update a particular course, as it will no longer be available in winter semesters. Following a notification to the IT team, the system will update so that course for the winter semesters will be changed to unavailable. Students who have had this course in their schedule for that current or following semester will be notified by the application. They will then have to choose when to take that course for another available semester, or pick a different course entirely. Student can let the CalendarCompanion choose another time/course and reorder other courses, or just simply drop that course.
    </p>

	<p>To address the needs of a potentially busy and overwhelmed student, the CalendarCompanion will be able to organize a full length degree schedule. However, the application must overcome a issue common in course registration where a course is too full to register. The CalendarCompanion will be able to completely organize a student schedule, but it can’t sign conduct automatic registration. Instead, the application notifies the student of a full course, and attempts to suggest an alternative, or offers the user to manually choose. Furthermore, the CalendarCompanion offers a recompilation system to provide students with a new schedule if they do not sign up for the required courses in time.

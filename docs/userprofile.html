    <h2>Bob (Student)</h2>

<p>
Bob is a newly graduated high-school student looking to start post-secondary at Uvic. He knows very little about the university system, and how it works, but he would like to pursue a degree in business. He's willing to live on campus for his first year, but he's unsure how and when to study. He's heard of the co-op program, but is a bit confused on how to gain entry. He's a guy who likes to know what to do, and where he needs to go long before he goes to do it, so he loves to make weekly schedules.
<p>
For Bob, our solution can perfectly suit his needs and give him a better understanding of Uvic. Although Bob only got accepted into the faculty of social science at first, the CalendarCompanion has given him his first year plan to take the courses he needs to have to get accepted into business, and developed the rest of his business degree schedule. Bob now knows that he must do well to get accepted into co-op, and has been given recommendations for study habits to achieve the performance he wants. On top of this, he now has a detailed campus map for a supposed weekly route to and from classes. Now that the CalendarCompanion has elaborated the process of obtaining his degree and given him the resources he'll need, it's now up to Bob to obtain it.


<h2>Prof. Sam (Faculty)</h2>
<p>
Sam is a long time professor of the university. He teaches Stats and introductory math, but now must deal with an unexpected opportunity, that needs him to leave the university for a whole year. Although he knows of the new website and CalendarCompanion, he has no idea how to utilize it to cancel the lectures he planned to teach next year.
<p>
Lucky for Sam, the CalendarCompanion is able to modify his teaching schedule. Sam only needs to log in with his credentials, view his planned teaching schedule by semester, and cancel his courses for next year. Administration will be notified, and confirm with sam that this is true, and perhaps plan for another instructor to take over for him. The students who have signed up for his course will then be notified, and the CalendarCompanion will work with each student for potential alternatives to their schedule

<h2>Lisa (Parent)</h2>
<p>
Lisa recently dropped off her boy Jeremy to Uvic so he can pursue becoming a mathematician. Although Lisa feels confident her son will do well, she can't help but want to check on her son's performance. She would also like to know her son's course schedule, so she knows when Jeremy will be free to call.
<p>
For Lisa, all she'll need to know is her sons Uvic credentials, and log in through the parental option to see his CalendarCompanion. The AI and webpage will let her know Jeremy's schedule, and and current performance in his classes.

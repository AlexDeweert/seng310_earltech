    <h1>User needs for the system</h1>
    <p>Combining user needs and requirements is an effective method to achieve a proper final solution. Furthermore, the two are major key abstractions from the entire design process. In fact, according to the FDA and George’s Lectures, the user needs are the first step in the entire design process, and are a great help to define the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>There are two major cases for when implementing user needs. The “intended use” and “indications for use”. To expand, The “intended use” is a main generalization of what the application/business/product does. On the other hand, “Indications for use” describe the problems or instances that the creation may solve.
    </p>
    <p>Aswell, defining user needs are important in the design process as they may direct the entire team into the same clear vision. With everyone on the right wavelength, the design team may have a better understanding of ideas and possibly come up with solutions at a higher level.

    <p>In general, the device CalendarCompanion provides all users with an organized schedule for their entire post secondary career. For exchange and cooperative work, it may accompany third party universities as well. For example, if an individual would like to go on exchange in the Fall semester of 2022, they would be able to pick courses from the selective universities available. In another instance, Say an individual would like to do an online course while doing their cooperative work term. The user would be prompted to simply sign in and select the desired online course.
    </p>
    <p>The distinguishing effect of CalendarCompanion for a user is the ability to not only plan one distinct semester of studies, but they are able to structure their entire course map for the entire duration of their studies. Another remarkable feature is that users may query their very own Virtual Assistant. If faced with a scheduling issue or course clash, the virtual assistant will run though tests and create a solution. Through rigorous algorithms, the Virtual Assistant may adjust your classes based around your preferred graduating year, favorable studying hours and even distance between classes!

    <p>The user may interact with the application on a laptop or mobile device. To use the system, users will need to be accepted into UVIC. Following this creating a profile and registering your v number will allow you to access UVIC’s online features and many more. Navigate to “Coursespaces” to encounter the CalendarCompanion. An internet connection is mandatory to use the application.
    </p>
    <p>The users of the application will be those aiming to receive a degree of high education through the university of Victoria. Aswell, teachers and professors at uvic alongside with the uvic IT team undergo administrative roles.  It is strongly recommended for high school students to utilize the application, as university is a grand leap into the real world, and having a structured and organizational degree map planned out may provide calm in the fire. As well, parents may visit the course map and take further inspections to validate the education that their youth receives. The application is available in 30 different languages, providing support for international students and families</p>
    <p>As for important features, there are many cases to consider. Say a professor knows that a course will be discontinued by a certain year. Following a notification to the IT team, the system will updates so that course for all the discontinued year and following years will be unavailable. Students who have had this course in their schedule for that current or following year will be notified by the application that the course is unavailable. They will then be queried by the application; facing an ultimatum of immeasurable proportions: “Please select another course or simply drop the course by the expiring year.” Subsequently, the course will be dropped from the database of existing course options for users.

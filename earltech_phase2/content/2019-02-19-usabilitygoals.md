1. <b>Effectiveness</b><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either a student user or parent would like to flawlessly pinpoint classroom locations, and organize their schedule based on a dynamic map that may change with a potentially changing course lineup. A student or course advisor would like the ability to swap or drop courses without major scheduling errors or unforeseen repercussions.

2. <b>Efficiency</b><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student user would like routes to their next class to be optimized in terms of travel-time, but not necessarily distance say. For example, if the shortest path is congested with students during the busiest end-of-class times, the path would be the least congested, possibly longer than the shortest distance, but still travel time optimal.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student or University faculty member, such as a course advisor, would like the CalendarCompanion to carry out tasks in a fast an efficient manner. Students would like speed for obvious reasons, but the faculty member has a busy schedule and deals with many students every day, so program time efficiency is paramount.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A university faculty member from another university would like the ability to efficiently create transfer or exchange friendly course mappings in a time efficient and painless way.

3. <b>Utility</b><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student user would like to have access to a suite of features that, while normally available through brute force Coursespace navigation, are available through a centralized CalendarCompanion application, easily accessible and integrated.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University faculty members would like the ability to add or remove course offerings.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University faculty members would like the ability to add additional lecture sections based on waitlist numbers.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent would like to have the ability to check their child-students grades and transcripts.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent would like to have access to course reviews, professor reviews, and past course averages to ensure that child-students get the best education possible.

4. <b>Learnability</b><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new student user who might feel overwhelmed by the beginning of their University experience would like a basic tutorial to assist with learning a centralized and integrated tool such as CalendarCompanion.

5. <b>Memorability</b><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student user, after learning to use CalendarCompanion for the first time, would like to have memorable icons, and non-overwhelming button designs or complex button naming conventions.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student user would like to have the ability to go through the tutorial system again, or to have access to a hover-and-help pointer option to get more information about what a button or menu item does.

    <h1>User requirements</h1>
    <h2>The software will do the following for the specific stakeholder/user</h2>
	<h2>Student:</h2>
	<ol type="1">
        <li>Log in to coursespaces account on mobile or desktop and navigate to CalendarCompanion for access, creating a unique CalendarCompanion account for the user.</li>
		<li>Allow student to configure desired degree map/schedule through multiple ways. <br>
			<ol type="i">
				<li> The student may chat and provide details (faculty, preferred Graduating Year, number of courses per semester) to the Virtual Assistant to automatically compile a chronological sequence of semesters based on user preferences. </li>
				<li> Whether a user is stuck navigating through the application or is having trouble setting up a semester, the Virtual Assistant will be able to resolve any difficulties encountered.</li>
				<li> The student has the option to modify or fine tune the semesters in order to obtain the perfect schedule for each studying term. This can be done through toggling data fields while designing their degree map. Additionally, courses booked online or through exchange will also be recognized by the CalendarCompanion</li>
				<li> The software then displays each semester the user has designed intuitively through multiple data representations (graphs, pie charts, interfaces, map of UVIC).</li>

			</ol>
		</li>
        <li>By saving the desired degree schedule/map, CalendarCompanion will notify the student and remind them before course registration begins, reminding them to sign up for their respective planned term courses.</li>
        <li>For international students, the CalendarCompanion provides multiple languages.</li>
        <li>If a course is full, the CalendarCompanion may recalibrate your degree map in order to graduate as efficiently as possible.</li>
		<li>If a course is deemed terminated for a specific degree requirement, notify the students to update their schedule/degree map.</li>
		<li>The software is able to determine if degree requirements are not fulfilled within a degree map/schedule. Students will be notified to make immediate changes.</li>
		<li>If a student accidentelly deletes a course by accident, there is an undo button to revert to the previous degree map.</li>
		<li>If a student deletes a mandotary pre/co-requisite to another course, a border will apply to said course with a message deeming that they must complete a specific pre/co-requisite before enrolling in said class.</li>

    </ol>
	<h2>Administration (UVIC staff, faculty, professors):</h2>
	<ol type="1">
        <li>Log in to coursespaces account on mobile or desktop and navigate to CalendarCompanion for access, creating an administrative CalendarCompanion account.</li>
        <li>Update new courses and lecture sections for students to select from throughout the years. Fill in all data fields relevant to the courses updated so that the users (students) may have optimal course selection.</li>
        <li>Wants to graduate and go on exchange in the next two years of her degree. </li>

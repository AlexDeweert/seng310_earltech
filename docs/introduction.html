    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
	The University of Victoria has its own centralized website for use by students and faculty to manage various elements of their relationship with UVic. Particularly, students new and current can use the website to sign up for courses, explore degree options and manage their payments to the university. However, although the current build of the website does offer these things, it does not provide an easy to use and practical format to deliver the services to the user. Additionally, various things that could help students plan for their degree, for example course charts, are not easily accessible. Even students who are very new to the concept of a university are not provided with enough information to fully understand where to go around campus, how their degree works and the various opportunities they may have while pursuing it. The current UVic website is not optimized to help students manage their courses. It does not clearly present available sections, what terms its available in, nor a map of where the course would. The website does not provide a solid help system for students to plan out the flow of their degree. Currently, little information is provided to new students about how they should progress through the university's programs. Our solution proposes and highlights a web based application to help students plan and organize their university classes, while also providing a web-based AI to answer questions students may have about the university. their degree, and other things.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the device CalendarCompanion provides all users with an organized schedule for their entire post secondary career. For exchange and cooperative work, it may accompany third party universities as well. For example, if an individual would like to go on exchange in the Fall semester of 2022, they would be able to pick courses from the chosen exchange university for that future semester. If the student changes their mind and wishes to not pursue co-op, they may easily drop their co-op semester and replace it with another semester to obtain their goal of specific year graduation. Similarly, they may instead redistribute the credits they would’ve obtained during co-op towards other semesters. In another instance, say an individual would like to do an online course while doing their cooperative work term. The user would be prompted to simply sign in and add the desired online course to the preferred semester they would like to complete it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user may interact with the application on a laptop or mobile device. But the distinguishing effect of CalendarCompanion for a user is the ability to not only plan one distinct semester of studies, but to structure an entire course map for the duration of their degree. Another remarkable feature is that users may query their very own Virtual Assistant. If faced with a scheduling issue or course clash, the virtual assistant will run though tests and create a solution. The Virtual Assistant may adjust your classes based around your preferred graduating year, favorable studying hours and even distance between classes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The users of the application will be UVic students, faculty involved in administrative roles, and IT personnel. It is strongly recommended for high school students to utilize the application, as university is a different and more complicated learning environment, and having a structured and organized degree map planned is immensely beneficial. As well, parents may visit the course map and take further inspections to validate the education that their youth receives. The application is available in 30 different languages, providing support for international students and families

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the needs of the faculty, Say a professor needs to update a particular course, as it will no longer be available in winter semesters. Following a notification to the IT team, the system will update so that course for the winter semesters will be changed to unavailable. Students who have had this course in their schedule for that current or following semester will be notified by the application. They will then have to choose when to take that course for another available semester, or pick a different course entirely. Student can let the CalendarCompanion choose another time/course and reorder other courses, or just simply drop that course.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the needs of a potentially busy and overwhelmed student, the CalendarCompanion will be able to organize a full length degree schedule. However, the application must overcome a issue common in course registration where a course is too full to register. The CalendarCompanion will be able to completely organize a student schedule, but it can’t sign conduct automatic registration. Instead, the application notifies the student of a full course, and attempts to suggest an alternative, or offers the user to manually choose. Furthermore, the CalendarCompanion offers a recompilation system to provide students with a new schedule if they do not sign up for the required courses in time.

## Overall, The CalendarCompanion should provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An option to login on mobile or desktop as either a student, parent, or faculty member

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Virtual Assistant able to introduce how to use the CalendarCompanion, ask queries about the student (filling information in the backend to optimize schedules), offer assistance or answer any questions pertinent to the CalendarCompanion. In addition, through analysis of the student information such as degree declaration, preferred number of courses per semester, year of graduation,the Virtual Assistant will be able to provide multiple degree map/schedules with detailed class information.

Different displays for all courses in generated degree map/schedule through multiple formats including:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pie charts, graphs, or tables of elective, prerequisite, and core course ratios.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option to replace (delete and add) specific courses<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific data included for each displayed course (required textbook, hours per week)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapping and scheduling features should also include manual user customization either generated degree/map via Virtual Assistant or creation of empty degree map to fine tune each semester. In addition, feedback on each customization; for example, a feature that notifies students about any changes it might make to degree goals. Also, the ability to include online courses offered through different universities. Online courses offered through different universities to should be an option. Finally, the ability to save or delete entire degree map/schedules

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminders for students signed up through uvic and personal email that course registration is approaching.

# Phase 4: Evaluation

Welcome to the Evaluation portion of the CalendarCompanion application.

## Evaluation Strategy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purposes of the Companion Calendar evaluation sessions are to assess the application productivity for further improvement and to discover if the interface conforms to design principles. During the evaluations, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. Following this, the Earl Technology team will extrapolate the data to discover any common discrepancies or deviation from the original usability and UX requirements. After analysis, the team will be able to update CalendarCompanion according the data results, fulfilling the evaluation purposes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation itself will involve observing randomly selected University of Victoria students attempting to accomplish a set list of tasks on the application via our two High Fidelity prototypes hosted on **Proto.io**.  Through observing the student performing tasks, the Earl Technologies team will decide if the application meets usability and user requirements for each iteration. As well, quantitative and qualitative data will be recorded during and after task completion. This data will be used in reflection to build upon any recommendations the test subject suggests. If encountered, we wish to improve on erroneous or ineffective functions mentioned in our qualitative data results. The tasks themselves will expose users to collective data about a sample university, including info about the student, institution, and courses that are available/registered by the student, through our interface. We hope to learn if our interface and organizational philosophy is effective in providing the students with useful information. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three constraints that must be achieved for the Evaluation Strategy. Firstly, **Able-Bodiedness**. The student that performs the evaluation must be able-bodied. This is because our application does not currently support Voice Control. Therefore, Students participating in the evaluation must be able to operate a Desktop device with their hands in order to participate. This brings the second constraint, **A Desktop or Laptop** device. The application is hosted on Proto.io, which requires a Desktop or Laptop for optimal functionality. Our third constraint is **Time**. During our labs, we have a max time of 20 minutes for our evaluations. This means that with our time with University Of Victoria students will be limited and we will need to accomplish as much as possible within 20 minutes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The variation in our prototypes were simple changes to the 3-bar drop down menu present on every page. Both versions are a vertical list with a descriptive name for each option (ex, Main Menu, Help, User Account, etc.).

Variant A :

Each option in the vertical list has a unique black icon on the right side of the bar.

Variant B:

Each option EXCEPT for “Study Assistant” and “Main Menu” Have the unique black icons on the right side of the bar.

Our theory behind this is that if we want a simple way for the options that we think might be used the most, (In this case we chose “Study Assistant” and “Main Menu”) to better stand out, they are devoid of an icon, so they are different enough to attract a users attention at first glance. Those two options are also spaced 4-options apart so the pattern follows: 4 icons, no icon

## Evaluation Plan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the Why, Who, How, What, Where, and When of our evaluation plan:

### Why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the evaluation strategy, the general idea is to obtain a form of criticism for our application, and see if the changes across Variants A and B affect user performance. After the users complete the tasks, answers to the qualitative and quantitative questions will provide our development team with some metric by which to make improvements. Essentially, we are trying to ascertain if there any design discrepancies conflict with the desired user experience.

### Who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation may be performed on either a single users, or many simultaneously. A team member will distribute a consent form any participating student in the lab. Signing this consent form indicates that the student will participate in the evaluation and that they are aware of the implications of doing so.

### What
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend on evaluating fundamental tasks of our application based on user requirements stated in previous phases. Tasks involve navigating to different features and interacting with them respectively. For example, we will ask the user to Navigate to the CSC100 Course Information page under the Future Courses feature. Quantitatively, we will monitor each user taking part in the evaluation and will record how many clicks were required, and how much time was needed to complete each task. Qualitatively, users will be asked to provide feedback and/or recommendations based on their experiences.

### How
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation facilitates discovery of inefficient implementations in our design. In addition, it serves to benefit the productivity of users who will utilize the application. Users will answer qualitative and quantitative questions provided to them in person by a facilitator. The answers received are intended to enlighten the design team on any features which could use improvement. Furthermore, usability will be assessed based on previously established usability requirements. The usability data is mostly gathered from qualitative data collection questions which will then be used to change the application as necessary.

### Where and When
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation can take place anywhere. However, at this phase of design, the evaluation will take place in the Engineering Lab Wing, room B220 on March 18th, 2019 between 4:30 p.m to 6:00 p.m.

## Facilitators Script
Facilitator: Greetings! My name is __________, a representative of Earl Technologies. 

I’d would like to thank you for attending today. We are gathered to evaluate Earl Technologies latest and greatest product: The CalendarCompanion. 

Earl Tech has implemented an effective new application providing a user friendly interface with the notorious UVIC CourseSpaces website and most of its underlying functionality. We believe that this application is much more effective than its predecessor. We would like to confirm our beliefs through an evaluation with yourselves evaluating the application.

Before we get started, please consider this consent form for the evaluation :

*hand out consent form(s)*

Facilitator: We would like to inform you this information is not mandatory whatsoever. However,  if you would like to participate in this evaluation, please sign the consent form.

*If the student(s) signed the consent form, begin evaluation below*


*Otherwise, end the evaluation for the particular students and ask them to leave.*

Facilitator: Once you’ve signed the consent form, flip the page to see a list of tasks along with questions about that task. For each task, we will have it displayed on the screen, and we will attempt one task at a time to ensure all participants are up to date. 

I’d like to bring your attention to the screen in front of you with the proto.io page open. You should see a login screen to our app. We will begin shortly.

For each task being evaluated, there will be a timer on the projected screen so that you may mark down the time it took for you to accomplish said task. 

Aswell, we would like you to mark down how many taps or clicks it took you to accomplish a task, to see the average speed of task completion.

If you require any assistance, please do not hesitate to ask. Before we begin are there any questions?

*Answer questions as necessary*

Facilitator: Just a reminder,If you’ve signed the consent form, please remember to mark down how many clicks it took to accomplish the task, as well as the time it took by referring at the screen!

Here we Go! The first task is to:

Log In as a student. You may begin in 3..2...1… start! 

*timer Starts*

*User completes tasks as they are able to, and write down their times and clicks for each*
*Remind the user if they ask what task they are to do next. Do not give any hints as to how the user should accomplish each task*

*When all tasks are completed:*

Facilitator: Now that you have completed all of the tasks we will move to part two of the evaluation, the qualitative questionnaire. It is located under the quantitative data section of your form. If needed, don’t hesitate to ask for help. Furthermore, once you are done, we will collect your sheet(s).

### Goals for Quantitative Results
We will gather the time it takes to perform one action which is based on each task in the cognitive walkthrough. In addition, we will also determine the number of clicks that the user makes in order to achieve the task. A stopwatch will be used to time the action. The clicks will simply be counted by a test administrator.

**Task A**: Log in as a student

**Task B**: Discover one assignment or test and it’s brief details from the Study Assistant.

**Task C**: Find one school event that you might be interested in given what’s available in any of the screens that advertise such

**Task D**: The latest finance/bill that has been paid from the Student Finances page

**Task E**: Find office hours and ratings for Professor FooBar at Uvic in the Find my Prof page

**Task F**: Find CSC100 On the future courses pages.

**Task G**: Sign Out

### Qualitative Questions

**1) [Structured]**: Was there anything that you found frustrating while interacting with the user interface of the CalendarCompanion application?

**2) [Unstructured]**: What was your overall opinion of the application following the completion of the tasks?

**Answers of “Test Subject-1” (Variant A)**

**1)**: User reported no frustrations - (“Nah”)


**2)**: User reported: “It was fine -- I had a fine time” and later added: “completion of the tasks were easy”

**Answers of “Test Subject-2” (Variant B)**

**1)**: User reported: “Not really, but the logging in screen seemed kinda klunky”


**2)**: User reported: “It felt very nice, using the drop down menu to get pretty much everywhere was good. I did make a few mistakes, but that was probably just my bad.”


**Summary of Result**s
The quantitative results showed that our design is intuitive and easy to navigate. Nearly all of the cognitive tasks that were required were completed by the users in the minimum number of clicks required. In terms of time taken, the time to navigate the menus, button clicks, and labels was slightly higher than what we expected. However, such times are to be expected after someone’s first exposure to a new user interface.

The qualitative results were surprisingly positive. The test subjects did not express any major displeasure following the completion of tasks A through F, although Subject 2 did point out the Log-in screen felt a little off.

Comparing the results of Variant A and Variant B, we don’t have enough results to fairly compare our data, as we only have 2 participants. However, While facilitating, we noticed that Subject 2, had a slightly faster time completing Task B. Which may be because the option from the drop-down menu to get to the Study Assistant had no icon, unlike all the others, which may have made it easier to find.

**Design Recommendation**
Paying attention to our participants, we found that our design was inconsistent in terms of “back” button functionality. Sometimes, if a user mis-clicked, they would be required to click on the main menu again, starting over from the beginning of the cognitive task. Many pages do have back buttons, but the buttons themselves are either in different locations (inconsistent spatial location from page to page), or they do not exist all together. The recommendation would be to overhaul the back button functionality, making it more consistent across all pages. On top of that, perhaps we should keep with Variant B’s design, and have some drop-down menu options devoid of icons so they are easier to locate.

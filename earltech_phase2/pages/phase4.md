# Phase 4: Evaluation

Welcome to the Evaluation portion of the CalendarCompanion application.

## Evaluation Strategy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purposes of the Companion Calendar evaluation sessions are to assess the application productivity for further improvement and to discover if the interface conforms to design principles. During the evaluations, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. Following this, the Earl Technology team will extrapolate the data to discover any common discrepancies or deviation from the original usability and UX requirements. After analyzation, the team will be able to update the Companion Calendar according the data results, fulfilling the evaluation purposes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation itself will involve observing randomly selected University of Victoria students attempting to accomplish a set list of tasks on the application via our High Fidelity prototype hosted on **Proto.io**.  Through observing the student performing tasks, our Earl Technologies team will decide if the application meets usability and user requirements for each iteration. As well, quantitative and qualitative data will be recorded during and after task completion. This data will be used in reflection to build upon any recommendations the test subject suggests. If encountered, we wish to improve on erroneous or ineffective functions mentioned in our qualitative data results. The tasks themselves will expose users to collective data about a sample university, including info about the student, institution, and courses that are available/registered by the student, through our interface. We hope to learn if our interface and organizational philosophy is effective in providing the students with useful information. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three constraints that must be achieved for the Evaluation Strategy. Firstly, **Able-Bodiedness**. The student that performs the evaluation must be able-bodied. This is because our application does not currently support Voice Control. Therefore, Students participating in the evaluation must be able to operate a Desktop device with their hands in order to participate. This brings the second constraint, A Desktop or Laptop device. The application is hosted on Proto.io, which requires a Desktop or Laptop for optimal functionality. Our third constraint is Time. During our labs, we have a max time of 20 minutes for our evaluations. This means that with our time with University Of Victoria students will be limited and we will need to accomplish as much as possible within 20 minutes.

## Evaluation Plan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After extensive research, the Earl Technologies team to display the evaluation plan by answering a series of questions. These key questions will answer all possible questions and concerns about the plan. The questions, Why, Who, How, What, Where, and When are categorized below:

### Why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Evaluation Strategy, the evaluation is to obtain criticism for our application. After the users complete the tasks, By asking quantitative and qualitative questions, we are able to assess the application productivity for further improvement and discover if the interface conforms to design principles from the answers. We are trying to answer if there any overall discrepancies in our application design or if there may be any improvements made.

### Who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the evaluation plan, you may also perform the evaluation with one single user, to achieve a more interpersonal evaluation. However, during the lab evaluations/presentations, multiple users will be evaluating the application at once. To manage this, during the introduction of our presentation, a team member will distribute a consent form to each student in the lab. Signing this consent form indicates that the student will participate in the evaluation. To compensate multiple evaluations at once, evaluations will be grouped by rows in the computer laboratory. An Earl Technology team member will be present in each row, overviewing the evaluation process, answering any questions. 

### What
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend on evaluating very fundamental tasks of our application based on user requirements. Tasks involve navigating to different features and interacting with them respectively. For example, we will ask the user to Navigate to the CSC100 Course Information page under the Future Courses feature. Doing this, users will need to record the time and amount of clicks it took to achieve this task. Quantitatively, we expect users to record how many clicks were needed and how much time was needed to interact with different widgets. Qualitatively, a task we wish users to complete is to give us feedback and/or recommendations on the application. 

### How
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation will be a study in regards to discovering any inefficient implementations in our design, and to further overall greatly benefit the productivity of our application. This will be performed through a Usability Study in regards to our application. Users will answer qualitative and quantitative questions on the back side of the Consent Form. The answers we receive are intended to enlighten us on any features which could use improvement. Furthermore, usability will be assessed based on our established usability requirements from the early Companion Calendar developmental stages. The usability data is mostly gathered from our qualitative data collection questions. We will interpret quantitative data from taking the averages of task completion time, and further investigating if any tasks may be optimized for user performance.

### Where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough, the evaluation is made to unroll in a Computer Science Lab. However, this evaluation may be performed anywhere as long as each student is provided with a Laptop/Desktop computer and internet connection. This is because the introduction, evaluation and conclusion is performed with a script, so as long as an Earl Technology team member is present along with a consent form, the evaluation may be performed!

### When
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intended to be evaluated during the tutorial section of Software Engineering 310, But realistically, anytime (See Where).

## Consent Form
[See bottom]

### Task Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users will be asked to perform a series of task and record how much time and how many clicks it took to perform each task. Users will have approximately 10 minutes to complete all the tasks and write down all the data on the back of the consent form. The tasks are displayed on the projector in front of the class one at a time, then followed by a screen 

1. Log in as a student.
2. Discover one assignment or test and it’s brief details from the Study Assistant.
3. Find one school event that you might be interested in given what’s available in any of the screens that advertise such.
4. The latest finance/bill that has been paid from the Student Finances page.
5. Find office hours and ratings for Professor FooBar at Uvic in the Find my Prof page.
6. Find CSC100 On the future courses pages.
7. Sign out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once all tasks are completed and quantitative data is recorded (How long it took to achieve a certain task, how many clicks were needed) users will be asked to answer the qualitative questions, which ask the user mostly for recommendations and any issues they had within application usage.

### Goals for Quantitative Results
We will gather the time it takes to perform one action which is based on each task in the cognitive walkthrough. In addition, we will also determine the number of clicks that the user makes in order to achieve the task. A stopwatch will be used to time the action. The clicks will simply be counted by a test administrator.

**Task A**: Log in as a student

**Task B**: Discover one assignment or test and it’s brief details from the Study Assistant.

**Task C**: Find one school event that you might be interested in given what’s available in any of the screens that advertise such

**Task D**: The latest finance/bill that has been paid from the Student Finances page

**Task E**: Find office hours and ratings for Professor FooBar at Uvic in the Find my Prof page

**Task F**: Find CSC100 On the future courses pages.

**Task G**: Sign Out

### Quantitative Results
**Task A** 5s, Min required: 4 clicks, Actual: 4 clicks
**Task B** 25s, Min required: 5 clicks, Actual: 5 clicks
**Task C** 6s, Min required: 4 clicks, Actual: 3 clicks
**Task D** 8s, Min required: 3 clicks, Actual: 3 clicks
**Task E** 24, Min required: 9 clicks, Actual: 12 clicks
**Task F** 30s, Min required: 9 clicks, Actual: 11 clicks
**Task G** 5s, Min required: 2 clicks, Actual: 2 clicks

### Qualitative Questions

**Structured**: Was there anything that you found frustrating while interacting with the user interface of the CalendarCompanion application?


**Unstructured**: What was your overall opinion of the application following the completion of the tasks?

**Answers of “TestSubjectOne”**

**Structured**: Was there anything that you found frustrating while interacting with the user interface of the CalendarCompanion application?

“User reported no frustrations”


**Unstructured**: What was your overall opinion of the application following the completion of the tasks?

“User had a fine time. Reported that completion of the tasks were easy”


**Summary of Result**s
The quantitative results showed that our design is intuitive and easy to navigate. Nearly all of the cognitive tasks that were required were completed by the user in the minimum number of clicks required. In terms of time taken, the time to navigate the menus, button clicks, and labels was slightly higher than what we expected. However, such times are to be expected after someone’s first exposure to a new user interface.

The qualitative results were surprisingly positive. The test subject did not express any displeasure following the completion of tasks A through F.

**Design Recommendation**
We found that our design was inconsistent in terms of “back” button functionality. Sometimes, if a user mis-clicked, they would be required to click on the main menu again, starting over from the beginning of the cognitive task. Many pages do have back buttons, but the buttons themselves are either in different locations (inconsistent spatial location from page to page), or they do not exist all together. The recommendation would be to overhaul the back button functionality, making it more consistent across all pages.
